\section{Implementation}
We implement our tool in JavaScript because we want our tool to be a web-based application, which can be easy to access. JavaScript also has a library called D3.js that is used for producing data visualization in web browsers. Our tool can be run in web browsers. We use the built-in HTTP server , \texttt{SimpleHTTPServer}, to test and run our tool. Next we describe UI components and other tools we use in order to implement our web-based application.
\subsection{UI Components}
Our tool consists of multiple UI components as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{World Map}: we use the geojson data~\cite{geocountries}, which contains information for each country, such as country polygon coordinates to draw the world map and ISO ALPHA-3 code.
	\item \textbf{Parallel Coordinate Plot:}
    \item \textbf{Country Infomation:}
	\item \textbf{Controller:}
    \item \textbf{Country Selector:}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Tools}
To created the preceding UI components, we mainly use HTML \texttt{<div>} tag with some CSS script to customize the UI components and the charts. For drawing charts and maps, we use D3.js, which provides several APIs.
